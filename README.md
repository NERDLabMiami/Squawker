# Squawker
## Project Overview
This mobile game prototype was developed to raise awareness about anxiety among college students. Through educational dialogue and conversation tree matching, players engage with an NPC who presents negative beliefs reflecting common concerns about seeking mental health help. The player's goal is to guide the NPC by selecting positive outcome beliefs, ultimately encouraging the NPC to seek peer or professional support. The game promotes the importance of recognizing and addressing mental health concerns through conversations. The player succeeds when the NPC agrees to seek help, reflecting a positive outcome for mental health advocacy. Development on this project has stopped, but the prototype is shared as open source to inspire further development or adaptation in mental health simulation and education.
